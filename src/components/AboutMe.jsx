                During my undergraduate years, my enthusiasm for coding led me to learn multiple programming languages, ultimately earning a <span style={{ color: "var(--hl-color)" }}>Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering</span>. This experience deepened my coding skills and introduced me to Python. My curiosity drove me to explore online courses in machine learning, culminating in a final year project where I developed a plant detection model and integrated it with an automated car.
