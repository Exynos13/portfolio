    "body": "Built an audience generator to create audience based on user entered keyword. Using the keyword the data was searched live using social media APIs of Reddit, X, Youtube and then collected Ethically. \nThe raw data which contained reddit posts and comments, youtube comments, tweets are then preprocessed using various preprocessing techniques such as lemmatisation, removal stop words and explicit words.  This pre processed data is then sent to the Roberta based transformer model which was trained on 124M tweets for sentiment analysis. \nBased on the result from the model all the data with the positive sentiment are considered right audience and the details of individual who posted that data is then stored in the database which can be used for future marketing. This Project is ideal for marketers, researchers, and social media managers looking to engage with a positively inclined audience.",
